## What It Does
TerraPulse is a comprehensive sustainability platform that features two key tools:

- **Waste Wise**: A smart waste management system that helps users track, categorize, and reduce waste. It provides actionable insights and eco-friendly suggestions to minimize waste generation.
  
- **Eco Route**: An advanced route planning tool that suggests the most sustainable travel options. Whether itâ€™s choosing public transport, biking, or walking, Eco Route helps users reduce their carbon footprint with every trip.

Together, these tools make sustainability easy, actionable, and impactful.

## How We Built It
We built TerraPulse using a combination of advanced technologies and tools:

- **Google Maps API**: For route planning and visualizations of travel options.
- **Google Gemini API**: To provide eco-friendly recommendations and suggestions.
- **Streamlit**: For creating a user-friendly and interactive web interface.
- **Folium and Plotly**: For visualizing routes and data analytics.
- **Python Libraries**: Such as `polyline` for decoding route data and `googlemaps` for geocoding and directions.

Our development process focused on integrating these tools into a seamless, intuitive application that enhances user experience while promoting sustainable practices.
